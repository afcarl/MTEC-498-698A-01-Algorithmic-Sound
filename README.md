## Schedule

### Session 01 - 01/23/17 - Overview / Installation / openFrameworks basics

This session will introduce the course, what algorithmic sound practice entails, and then introduce you to openFrameworks, a creative-coding toolkit written primarily in C++.  It brings together many frameworks for a cross-platform coding environment capable of real-time audio visual analysis, graphics, sound processing, 3D, multithreading, communication protocols, and plenty more.  In this session, we'll see how to navigate openFrameworks, build a project, compile existing examples, and find additional resources.

### Session 02 - 01/30/17 - Basic Graphics / Audio Recording

In the next two sessions, we'll explore the use of some basic audio and graphics primitives.  We'll see how to animate lines, and use them to control the recording and playback of audio.  The end result will be a sampler that can record/playback audio, automatically segment audio, and apply some simple filters such as windowing.  Along the way we'll learn about a lot of basic coding principles including if statements, for loops, and how to use classes to build objects and abstract our code.  We'll also see how to use parameters to define elements in a graphical user interface.

### Session 03 - 02/06/17 - Audio Interaction

We'll continue with developing a sampler that can record and playback audio.  The approach we take to develop our sampler will allow us to scale it arbitrarily, as well as add new functionality to it fairly easily.  We'll then explore another application which can chop audio automatically and we'll see how this can be used to create an infinitely generating track.  To do this, we'll first see how to use the RMS of an audio signal to automatically segment audio.  Then we'll use some basic statistics of the RMS to segment audio and create some randomized audio playback of audio "grains", and also see how to visualize them.

### Session 04 - 02/13/17 - Overflow + Project Week

In case there is any material we needed more time for + use class time with the TA to develop your first project.

### Session 05 - 02/20/17 - First Project Presentations

### Session 06 - 02/27/17 - Granular Synthesis

This session covers two methods for loading samples, maxiSample and pkmEXTAudio methods for reading and saving any audio format using Apples EXTAudio format.  Finally, we look at how to use maximilian's granular synthesis engine to independently pitch and time stretch the amen break.

### Session 07 - 03/06/17 - Advanced Audio Analysis

We'll look at the DFT, Mel Transform, Circular Buffers, and MFCCs for audio fingerprinting and analysis.  We'll then see how to organize sound using some of these features.

### Session 08 - 03/13/17 - Overflow + Project Week

Use class time with the TA to develop your first project.

### Session 09 - 03/20/17 - Second Project Presentations

### Session 10 - 03/27/17 - Sprint Break

### Session 11 - 04/03/17 - Machine Learning Part I

We will explore the use of kNN and tSNE for concatenative synthesis and visual exploration of a grain cloud.

### Session 12 - 04/10/17 - Machine Learning Part II

We'll explore the use of k-means clustering and markov chains for generative concatenative synthesis.

### Session 13 - 04/17/17 - Overflow + Project Week

### Session 14 - 04/24/17 - Final Project Presentations
